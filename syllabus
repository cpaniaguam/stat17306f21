02: 9-9:50 am<br>
03: 11-11:50 am <br>
</div>

This is an online
course with a hybrid modality. There will be live meetings during the
scheduled times (see above) via <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/download-app">Microsoft
Teams</a>.
You can
download Teams for free for your computer or mobile device. Login using
your Salve credentials and
join the course team by going to this <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a8bafad2db98a40c5a31fd9aea7927a32%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=7046a50f-0b0e-44d6-8f32-ffec1ea6b870&amp;tenantId=f0e0e20b-dffd-4b05-8c6c-74ab98a56cd9" target="_blank">page</a> or using the code <code>kphkhsa</code>.<br>

<br>

You may think of this course as being in a book club: We will have
weekly readings to read or videos to watch (all posted on Canvas) and
afterwards we get together to
discuss those readings/videos. Thus it is very important that every
participant comes to the live meetings
already having read/watched the assigned readings/videos for that week.<br>

<br>

Please note participants will need a computer/tablet (not smart phone)
with headphones, and reliable internet access to engage in the course
activities and work the course
assignments. For the benefit of participants unable to attend live
meetings,
<a href="https://salve.instructure.com/courses/3132532/pages/recordings-for-live-meetings/">recordings
of these</a> will be available on Canvas. If you need assistance
with technology you may contact our Technology
Services Center at <a href="mailto:tsc@salve.edu">tsc@salve.edu</a> or
401-341-7777 for answers to
technology-related questions.<br>

You can also reach me on Teams. Please use email for administrative
issues and Teams for all other <span style="font-style: italic;">quick</span>
consultations regarding the course. For more in-depth consultations see
<a href="#Asych">here</a> and the following.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Open hours</span> Monday, Wednesday,
Friday 12-1:50 pm or by appointment.
If you are unable to attend we can meet at other times by
appointment.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Description</span> This is a
no-prerequisite introduction to the concepts and methods of Statistics
and their applications. The search for truth is a human endeavor.
Statistics deals with putting together records/measurements (called <span style="font-style: italic;">data</span>) about a specific group of
people or things (called <span style="font-style: italic;">population</span>),
so that a researcher (a person who systematically seeks for
truth---perhaps you!) can make educated/reasonable predictions about
the population in question. This includes looking for structure in the
data, patterns, and communicating results. Many investigations in the
sciences, health care, education, government, and industry rely on
statistical studies for decision making. From the course catalog:
Topics
include exploratory data analysis, basic probability distributions,
sampling distributions, interval estimations, hypothesis testing, and
significance testing (P-Values) with single, paired and two-sample
problems.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Objectives</span> Upon completion of
the course participants should be able to<br>

<ol>

  <li>Define Statistics and describe its range of applications</li>
  <li>Discern appropriate from misleading use of statistics</li>
  <li>Understand the role of sampling in studying a population</li>
  <li>Identify the observational units and variables in a statistical
study</li>
  <li>Appreciate the importance of averages and variability in data</li>
  <li>Discern association from causation</li>
  <li>Appreciate the importance of randomized experiments and random
assignment in a statistical study</li>
  <li>Understand and appreciate the basic notions of probability:
random variable, probability distributions</li>
  <li>Construct adequate graphs for data sets and construct reasonable
conjectures (guesses)</li>
  <li>Apply basic statistical tests for inference, including confidence
intervals and hypothesis testing</li>
  <li>Produce numerical and visual summaries of data and perform data
analysis using software<br>
  </li>
</ol>

<strong>Evaluation</strong> Course assessment will consist of
participation, quizzes, and homework (yes, there are
no high-stakes exams!). Standard letter-grade
scale will apply. The breakdown is as follows.<br>

<ul>

  <li><em>Participation</em> - 10%, continuously throughout the
semester. More on this <a href="STA-173-06%20Statistical%20Methods,%20Fall%202020.html#Asych">below</a>.</li>
  <li><em>Quizzes</em> - 30%, about 1 every week. Quick assessments to
encourage participants to not fall behind.<em></em></li>
  <li><em>Weekly homework</em> - 60%. Hosted at myopenmath.com within
Canvas.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Expectations</strong><br>

<ol start="1">

  <li>Academic Integrity: All students are expected to accept and to
abide by the values of honesty, integrity, and truthfulness in their
academic pursuits. Sanctions for violations of academic honesty, such
as plagiarism or cheating range from failure for the work involved to
failure in the course. A record of violations and sanctions is
maintained in the student's file. Any violation may result in dismissal
from the University (Undergraduate Catalog). Academic honesty is taken
seriously in this class. Students committing academic dishonesty will
be subject to the consequences described in the Catalog as determined
by the professor. In short, everything you turn in must be your own
work!</li>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Examples of what is not OK to do:<br>
  </div>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <ul>
    <li>To let someone else see/copy your own work</li>
    <li>To fail to acknowledge in writing help given/received either
from
a person or otherwise</li>
    <li>To share files with other students</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
Examples of what is OK (encouraged) to do:<br>
  </div>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <ul>
    <li>Discuss (talk about) general ideas with other students and with
your instructor</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  <li>Before live meetings: That participants will come to live
meetings having thoroughly read the assigned readings/watched assigned
videos.</li>
  <li>During live meetings: I ask that participants will have their
cameras on at all times and be actively engaged (for example, asking a
lot of questions!) during discussions.</li>
  <li><a name="Asych"></a>After live meetings: To be engaged in
asynchronous discussions on
Piazza, a Q&amp;A platform within Canvas. I expect participants to make
    <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">at least one
contribution</span> (question, answer to a
question, something interesting or useful you discovered, etc.) <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">every
two weeks</span> in order to be in good
participation standing.<br>

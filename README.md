# STA-173 Statistical Methods, Fall 2021

## Meetings

M/W 1:00 - 2:15 PM, O'Hare 205

You may think of this course as being in a book club: We will have weekly readings to read or videos to watch (all posted on Canvas) and afterwards we get together to engage in ***active discussion*** of those readings/videos. Thus it is very important that every participant comes to the meetings already having read/watched the assigned readings/videos for that week.

## Instructor

Carlos Paniagua, [carlos.paniagua\@salve.edu](mailto:carlos.paniaguamejia@salve.edu). You can also reach me on Teams. Please use email for administrative issues (reporting missing class before it happens) and Microsoft Teams for all other *quick* consultations regarding the course. For more in-depth consultations see [Piazza](piazza.com/salve/fall2021/sta17306/home) and the following.

## Open hours

These are times we can meet one-on-one. You can see me after class or by appointment.

## Description

This is a no-prerequisite introduction to the concepts and methods of Statistics and its applications. The search for truth is a human endeavor. Statistics deals with carefully putting together records/measurements (called data) about a specific group of people or things (called population), so that a researcher (a person who systematically seeks for truth---perhaps you!) can make educated/reasonable predictions or inferences about the population in question. This includes looking for structure in the data, patterns, and communicating results. Many investigations in the sciences, health care, education, government, and industry rely on statistical studies for decision making. Topics include

1.  exploratory data analysis

2.  basic probability distributions

3.  sampling distributions

4.  interval estimations

5.  hypothesis testing

6.  significance testing (P-Values) with single, paired and two-sample problems.

## Objectives

1.  Define Statistics and describe its range of applications

2.  Discern appropriate from misleading use of statistics

3.  Understand the role of sampling in studying a population

4.  Identify the observational units and variables in a statistical study

5.  Appreciate the importance of averages and variability in data

6.  Discern association from causation

7.  Appreciate the importance of randomized experiments and random assignment in a statistical study

8.  Understand and appreciate the basic notions of probability: random variable, probability distributions

9.  Construct adequate graphs for data sets and construct reasonable conjectures (guesses)

10. Apply basic statistical tests for inference, including confidence intervals and hypothesis testing

11. Produce numerical and visual summaries of data and perform data analysis using software

## Materials

The **required** textbook is: D. Diez, M. Çetinkaya-Rundel, C.D. Barr (2019). OpenIntro Statistics, 4th Edition. Available for free (in pdf) at <https://leanpub.com/os>. I strongly suggest you invest in a print copy of the book (\$20 as of Aug 14, 2021) at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/OpenIntro-Statistics-Fourth-David-Diez/dp/1943450072/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=openintro&qid=1628975249&sr=8-1).

Optional and highly recommended for those more software oriented: Statistical Inference via Data Science: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse. A textbook with extra emphasis on use of technology (software package R) to perform statistical analysis, this resource is also freely available: <https://moderndive.com/index.html>.

## Evaluation

-   *Participation* - 10%, continuously throughout the semester. More on this below.

-   *Quizzes* - 30%, about 1 every week. Quick assessments to encourage participants to not fall behind.

-   *Weekly homework* - 60%. Hosted at [myopenmath.com](myopenmath.com) within Canvas.

## Expectations

1.  Academic Integrity: All students are expected to accept and to abide by the values of honesty, integrity, and truthfulness in their academic pursuits. Sanctions for violations of academic honesty, such as plagiarism or cheating range from failure for the work involved to failure in the course. A record of violations and sanctions is maintained in the student's file. Any violation may result in dismissal from the University (Undergraduate Catalog). Academic honesty is taken seriously in this class. Students committing academic dishonesty will be subject to the consequences described in the Catalog as determined by the professor. In short, everything you turn in must be your own work!

    Examples of what is **not** OK to do:

         -   To let someone else see/copy your own work

         -   To fail to acknowledge in writing help given/received either from a person      or otherwise

         -   To share files with other students

    Examples of what is OK (encouraged) to do:

         -   Discuss (talk about) general ideas with other students and with your instructor

2.  Before live meetings: That participants will come to live meetings having thoroughly read the assigned readings/watched assigned videos.

3.  During live meetings: I ask that participants will have their cameras on at all times and be actively engaged (for example, asking a lot of questions!) during discussions.

4.  After live meetings: To be engaged in asynchronous discussions on Piazza, a Q&A platform within Canvas. I expect participants to make **at least one contribution** (question, answer to a question, something interesting or useful you discovered, etc.) **every two weeks** in order to be in good participation standing.
